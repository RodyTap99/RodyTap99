### Hello! Welcome to my Github profile. I'm a biologist with a passion for technology and computer science. I'm currently focused on learning about machine learning and programming, and I'm studying a specialization in data analysis using the Python programming language.

My interest in programming and machine learning stems from my desire to apply these skills in my field of study in biology, where I believe they can be very useful for analyzing and understanding large biological datasets. I hope to use these tools to make significant contributions to the understanding and advancement of biology.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and practicing water sports. If you have any questions or want to discuss interesting projects where you may need my expertise, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for visiting my profile!
